A lone bird is perched atop the branch of a tree, watching over the surrounding area. It spies a lone walker, coated and shivering in the cold wind. It's snowing.

The bird tilts it's head slightly, and then swoops down to the cold figure, landing on their shoulder and peeking into their hood.

"H-hi..."
The bird chirps, then hops down to the ground, beckoning it's newfound companion to follow.
"Al..right, I'll follow you..."

The bird happily chirps, and takes flight again, flying towards a lone building. One that Kameron could have sworn they hadn't seen there before.

The house was prewarmed by a roaring fireplace, with cozy furniture surrounding it. There was a small, open roofed cage that the bird landed on the side of while Kameron walked in. They sighed, and flopped down onto the lounge. Their small feathered friend followed suit, hopping off of the side of it's cage and landing on Kam's shoulder again, puffing up comfortably and snuggling in.

Kameron sighed, and slowly drifted to rest. *What a helpful bird.*
